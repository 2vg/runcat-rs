original: [Kyome22/RunCat_for_windows](https://github.com/Kyome22/RunCat_for_windows)

A cute running cat animation on your windows taskbar, but made by Rust ðŸ¦€

It has a smaller binary size and less memory usage than the original.

** Also, there is no Parrot. What we want is a cat. à¸…\(^â€¢Ï‰â€¢^à¸… â—ž Ì‘Ì‘"**
